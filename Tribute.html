    <div id="tribute-info"> <h3>Here's a time line of Dilip Kumar's life:</h3>
    
    <ul> <li><strong>1922:</strong><b>Born</b>Mohammed Yusuf Khan (11 December 1922) </li>
        <li><strong>1940s:</strong><b>First film roles and initial success</b> 
        Kumar's first film was Jwar Bhata in 1944, which went unnoticed. After a few more unsuccessful films, it was Jugnu (1947), in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, that became his first major hit at the box office.His next major hits were the 1948 films Shaheed and Mela.</li>
        <li><strong>1950s:</strong> <b>Breakthrough years</b>
            Kumar went on to have success in the 1950s playing leading roles in several box office hits such as Jogan (1950), Babul (1950), Deedar (1951), Tarana (1951), Daag (1952), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955), Insaniyat (1955) in which he co-starred with Dev Anand, Devdas (1955), Naya Daur (1957), Yahudi (1958), Madhumati (1958) and Paigham (1959).[15] Several of these films established his screen image as the "Tragedy King".[16] Kumar briefly suffered from depression due to portraying many tragic roles and on the advice of his psychiatrist, he also took on light-hearted roles.[17] Mehboob Khan's big-budget 1952 swashbuckling musical Aan featured him in one of his first lighter roles[18] and marked his first film to be shot in technicolor. Aan was the first Indian film to have a wide release across Europe with a lavish premiere in London.[19] Aan was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, domestically[20] and overseas.He had further success with lighter roles as a thief in the comedy Azaad (1955), and as a royal prince in the musical Kohinoor (1960).
            </li>
        <li><strong>1960s:</strong><b>Mughal-e-Azam and venture into production</b>
            In 1960, he portrayed Prince Salim in K. Asif's big-budget epic historical film Mughal-e-Azam, which was the highest-grossing film in Indian film history for 11 years until it was surpassed by the 1975 film Sholay. If adjusted for inflation, Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Indian film through to the early 2010s, equivalent to over ₹1000 crore in 2011.</li>
        <li><strong>1970s:</strong><b>Career slump</b>
                Kumar's career slumped in the 1970s with the 1970 film Gopi being his only box office success. This film also marked his first pairing with his wife Saira Banu. That same year, they were paired again in his first and only Bengali film Sagina Mahato. In 1972, he once again played dual roles as twin brothers in Dastaan which was a box office failure.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s:</strong><b>Return to Success</b>In 1981, he returned to films as a character actor playing mature elderly roles. His comeback film was the star-studded historical epic Kranti which was the biggest hit of the year.Appearing alongside an ensemble cast including Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha, he played the title role as a revolutionary fighting for India's independence from British rule.In 1982, he collaborated with director Subhash Ghai for the first time with Vidhaata (1982), in which he starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sanjeev Kumar and Shammi Kapoor. Vidhatta was the highest grossing film of the year. Later that year he starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Ramesh Sippy's Shakti, which was an average grosser at the box office, but won him critical acclaim and his eighth and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[44] In 1984, he starred in Yash Chopra's social crime drama Mashaal opposite Anil Kapoor, which failed at the box office, but his performance was critically acclaimed.[45] He also appeared alongside Rishi Kapoor in Duniya (1984) and Jeetendra in Dharm Adhikari (1986).  </li>
        <li><strong>1990s:</strong>Directorial debut and final works
                    In 1990, he co-starred with Govinda in the action thriller Izzatdaar. In 1991, Kumar starred alongside fellow veteran actor Raaj Kumar in Saudagar, his third and last film with director Subhash Ghai. This was his second film with Raaj Kumar after 1959's Paigham. Saudagar was to be Kumar's penultimate film and last box office success. In 1994, he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the industry.  </li>
        <li><strong>2000-2021s:</strong><b>Shelved projects and political career</b>In 2001, Kumar was set to appear in a film titled Asar – The Impact alongside Ajay Devgan and Priyanka Chopra, which was shelved due to Kumar's declining health.[59] He was also set to appear in Subhash Ghai's war film Mother Land, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this film was shelved after Khan decided to leave the project.[60]
                    His classic films Mughal-e-Azam and Naya Daur were fully colourised and re-released in cinemas in 2004 and 2008 respectively.[61] An unreleased film he had shot and completed titled Aag Ka Dariya was set for a theatrical release in 2013 but has not been released to date.[62]
                    Kumar was a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's parliament, from 2000 to 2006.[63] He was nominated by the Indian National Congress to represent Maharashtra.[64][65] Kumar utilised a significant portion of his MPLADS fund towards the construction and improvement of the Bandstand Promenade and the gardens at Bandra Fort at Lands End in Bandra.  </li>
